# Revenue Insight of Hostpitality Domain

## Background

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue.

As a data analyst I have created new interactive dashboard using their sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task.

* To create the metrics according to the metric list.
* To create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
* To create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.
