## Background

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue.

As a data analyst I have created new interactive dashboard using their sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task.

* To create the metrics according to the metric list.
* To create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
* To create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

### Rental Analysis

The first step to building the dashboard is to work out all erros, null values and all the calculations and visualizations.

List of all key matrics -
* Revenue, Total Booking, Total Capacity, Average Rating, Number of days(Working day and weekend)
* Total Successful Booking, Total Cancelled Booking, Total No Show Booking, Total Checked Out
* Occupancy %, Cancelled %, No Show Rate %
* Booking % by Platform, Booking % by Room Class
* ADR(Average Daily Rate) - It is the ratio of revenue to the total rooms booked/sold. 
  It is the measure of the average paid for rooms sold in a given time period
* Realisation % =  The succesful "checked out" percentage over all bookings happened.
* RevPAR - Revenue Per Avaliable Room
* DBRN(Daily Booking Room Nights)
* DSRN(Daily Sellable Room Nights)
* DURN(Daily Utilized Room Nights)
* Revenue WoW change %
* Occupancy WoW change %
* ADR WoW change %
* RevPAR WoW change %
* Realisation WoW change %
* DSRN WoW change %

WoW - Week-on-Week (WoW) is a type of business metric that measures changes in a specific variable over a period of one week compared to the previous week. It is a common way of tracking business performance over time and is particularly useful for analyzing trends and identifying areas where improvements can be made.
